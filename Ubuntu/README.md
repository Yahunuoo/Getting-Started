>#### curl

Since you already have the terminal open, take the opportunity to install curl, which will let you install applications with just a URL, as you'll see us do soon. Use this command:

```bash
sudo apt install curl
```

## Zsh

Bash is Ubuntu's default shell (command interpreter), but Z shell is more commonly used in modern systems by default, so that's what we will use. Install it with this command, and accept the changes to be made by entering **`Y`** when prompted to continue:

```bash
sudo apt install zsh
```

Verify the installation with this command:

```bash
zsh --version
```
Make Zsh the default shell with this command:

```bash
chsh -s $(which zsh)
```

End your terminal session by closing the terminal window. Log out of your account, then log back in.

Open a new terminal window. As shown below, you should be prompted to run a configuration setup for new users:

Enter `2` to accept the default configuration.

Your terminal prompt should look a little different now!

Let's confirm it worked with this command:

```bash
echo $SHELL
```

This should print **`/usr/bin/zsh`**
